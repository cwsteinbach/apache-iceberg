# Time Travel

Currently time travel support for Iceberg tables is limited to Apache Spark's Dataframe API.

## Time Travel in Spark

To select a specific table snapshot or the snapshot at some time, Iceberg supports two Spark read options:

* `snapshot-id` selects a specific table snapshot
* `as-of-timestamp` selects the current snapshot at a timestamp, in milliseconds

```scala
// time travel to October 26, 1986 at 01:21:00
spark.read
    .option("as-of-timestamp", "499162860000")
    .format("iceberg")
    .load("path/to/table")
```

```scala
// time travel to snapshot with ID 10963874102873L
spark.read
    .option("snapshot-id", 10963874102873L)
    .format("iceberg")
    .load("path/to/table")
```

!!! Note
    Spark does not currently support using `option` with `table` in DataFrameReader commands. All options will be silently 
    ignored. Do not use `table` when attempting to time-travel or use other options. Options will be supported with `table`
    in [Spark 3.1 - SPARK-32592](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32592).

Time travel is not yet supported by Spark's SQL syntax.
